              <p>Our object consists of three parts, that being together, make up the whole process of perception of any information. 
             In the center there is the core (object, event) - an information center, the true point of reference, that we have represented in the form of a ball (like a perfect form) which radiance (as the real truth) is barely noticeable. 
             The core is surrouded by the information field, which consists of a variety of points (objects) that connected to each other thanks to webs, that are intertwined and spread everywhere between core (center) and direct attention to a person who is looking for this truth. The character of information field is created by the vacuum tubes (television), incandescent lamps (other people's ideas) and web (Internet), so the objects that represent the most common ways of dissemination of information. 

             So at the same time web of information creates communication and barriers between direct true and a person. 
            The third aspect of perception are plane or angles of view, through which a person sees a particular part of the information field. And these surfaces (windows) are so numerous and they are so different just because to emphasize that to understand and to see the all information field is impossible. Even if you choose many different angles, you still will not be able to cover all the information and the truth will always remain far and barely noticeable.</p>

              <p>There are several main aspects in the object - interaction, intervention, conflict, discord, harmony - conditions that take place in any environment: in nature, in society, in art ... 
The idea - to convey these conditions, using materials of "modern, urban city". 
That’s why the main materials are - metal, mirror, glass. 
The composition of conventionally divided into two parts, where there are two main materials and two completely opposing conflicts. 
The right side consists of two materials - metal and mirrors, but similar items - mostly squares and rectangles rather static and move and mix together harmoniously. There are elements in different environment which takes new places, but by their shapes they take favorable location. They absolutely do not contradict the new environment, they make it more complement and enrich, but these materials will always be different. But in this diversity is the beauty. This is a contrast of materials, but not a structure. 
The left part of the project, conversely, consists of one material - only of metal. But the components have a different shape, and therefore the content. And this is the conflict. Dynamic and aggressive triangles completely violate poise and balance of composition. That is the contrast again, but the contrast of structure. As a result, many elements of the composition "flipped" and "scattered", breaking static and harmonious way. This is the condition of instability and precariousness of elements. 
Not by chance in our work there is also the third material - glass, which is located in different parts of the work. It almost imperceptible, but creates some barriers to direct perception, adds diversity and complexity of the situation.</p>

<p>The reality - is complex and multifaceted notion. 
It seems to be objective, but at the same time, the perception of reality is always subjective. The reality may be flexible, fragile, can be exposed by some impact. So, the perception of reality can be compared with an unremittingly game that takes place around the surrounding area. 
To realize the visual image of "game of reality" – we are using the cooperation of two different materials: glass and metal, in combination, when at the same time there are two proses – and destruction, and binding. 
Our object consists of three broken windows. In two of them cracks are fastened with metal bolts. This interaction shows that a few little foreign elements in society can both split and fasten it, and do not allow completely disintegrate. In the third frame there is left only fragments and pieces of broken glass. It means that not every space can withstand the impact of a foreign elements. 
The idea of the window also was not chosen by chance. The window itself represents the moment of perception of reality. The frames of our windows are old and peeling. So we show what happens to the old perception of the fragile reality under external pressure.</p>
